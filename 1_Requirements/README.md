# Requirements

## Introduction ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32685217/119812960-5ca5a280-bf06-11eb-9187-fc18326452ad.png =50x50)
* Library Management System helps to maintain records of every issue, return transactions that happens in the libraries in computerized way.

* This helps the librarian in managing the library in a simple and easy manner, also helps to calculate the fines, collect the fines from the end-users.

* There are 2 modules, 
  1. Admin Module (Users: Librarian, and other library staff)
  2. Student Module (Users: Students and library users)

* This tool also creates snapshots of the data at hourly frequency, so that we can recover back to previous hour very easily.

## Research
* During the French Revolution, the then existing measurement system was so impractical for trade and scientific purposes. 

* So, it set the stage for the emergence of a system of measurement with rationally related units and simple rules for combining them.

* Thus, a decimal based conversion system, called the Metric System,  was introduced and it was widely accepted by scientists of those days for being a rational system.

* The metric system was devised with a aim “for all people, for all time.”

* Today, the official system of measurement in most of the countries across the world is the metric system also known as the “International System of Units.

* Though a standard system, there are many units within the metric systems and inter-conversion is tedious because one has to remember all the conversion factors.

* Hence a tool that makes all these conversion immediately available will be a welcoming choice.

## Cost and Features
### *Cost*
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!

*TBD*

### *Features*
The various features/options for interconversion of the system are:
1. Length
2. Area
3. Volume
4. Mass
5. Speed

## Defining the System

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The tool is a helping hand for young children who would like to counter verify their conversions and also for scientific researchers and mathematicians.

## What:

A metric conversion calculator that does metric conversions in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with simple conversions or when kids would like to cross verify their answers while practicing or when people need conversion results in a jiffy to proceed on further with their calculations. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:

The system opens up to the standard list of metric conversions that are available. Upon selection of one the standard system, the list of inter-conversions i.e., the sub-system is shown on the screen. The user can now choose one sub unit that needs to be converted into one or more other sub units that is available on the list.  The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.
